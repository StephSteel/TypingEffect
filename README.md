# Typing Effect

This is a simple HTML, CSS, and JavaScript project that creates a typing effect in a web page. The text "Steph is" is followed by dynamic words that change in a typewriter-like animation. This project uses keyframes and JavaScript.



# Customization

You can customize this typing effect to match your project's style and content. Here are a few things you can modify:

- Change the text within the `words` array to display your desired words or phrases.

- Adjust the styles in the CSS file (`style.css`) to match your project's design.

- Modify the animation timing in the JavaScript file (`script.js`) by changing the `setTimeout` values.
